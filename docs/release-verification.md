# Release verification

`tutorials/smolvlm_vision_language_colab.ipynb` (`TASK-INFERENCE`, **standalone** carrier) is a **release candidate** until the exact notebook
revision has executed top-to-bottom in a clean supported runtime. Unit tests, JSON validation,
code-cell compilation, the generator parity checks and `tools/validate_release_assets.py` are
necessary checks but are **not** runtime evidence under DIMER Notebook Specification 1.1. This file is the durable release-gate record for
the notebook.

## Automatic coverage (static, every pull request)

CI runs `tools/validate_release_assets.py`, which checks:

- notebook JSON parses; every code cell compiles as plain Python (no `%`/`!` magics); no
  persisted outputs or execution counts; no unresolved placeholder markers; every code cell
  is preceded by an explanatory markdown cell;
- exactly one tutorial notebook, named in `tutorials/README.md` with its `TASK-INFERENCE`
  profile, the notebook-spec version and the standalone carrier; `metadata.dimer` declares that
  profile, spec `1.1`, `standalone: true` and `generated_from` (repository, revision, module
  SHA-256, generator);
- the standalone carrier (ST1–ST6, PAR1–PAR3): no clone, repository install or repository import on
  the primary path; exactly one cell tagged `embedded_module` equal to
  `src/smolvlm_vision_language_pipeline/pipeline.py` after the generator's documented rewrites; the
  inline `MANIFEST` equal to the committed snapshot manifest and the inline `PINS` equal to the
  `pyproject.toml` runtime pins; the notebook byte-identical (on LF) to `tools/build_notebook.py`
  output for its recorded revision; the pinned-install cell with its restart-on-stale-import guard;
  `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE` recorded in exports;
- `MODEL_ID`/`MODEL_REVISION` are bound only in the carried module cell (and repeated in the inline
  manifest, which the notebook asserts against the module before fetching), the revision is a 40-hex
  immutable commit, and the same identity string appears in `README.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`, and
  `docs/WEIGHTS.md` with no stray revisions;
- the profile-specific public-API calls (`stage_missing_files`, `verify_snapshot`,
  `SmolVLMPipeline.from_pretrained(weights_dir=...)`, `validate_inputs` per prompt, `generate` with
  explicit `max_new_tokens` and `do_sample=False`, and `evaluation_report` over every answer), the
  ceiling and decoding constants carried by the module, the plumbing checks on greedy settings and
  token budget, the export with `truncated` flags and `pipe.dtype`,
  the learner-facing statements (greedy by default, free text with no score, the card's
  hallucination observation, SmolLM2-360M-Instruct cross-reference, no metric helper, no metric
  reported, single image) and the gated-off BYOD default listed in the validator; forbidden
  patterns (credential-in-URL, any `git clone` / `github.com` / repository import on the primary
  path, a mutable `revision='main'`, direct `transformers` or `huggingface_hub` use **outside the
  carried module cell**, `apply_chat_template`, `.generate(**`, `trust_remote_code=True`,
  `pickle.load`, `torch.load(`, `extractall(`);
- `STATUS.md`, `README.md` and `tutorials/README.md` agree on one release-status token and no
  document makes an unsupported release-grade, production-readiness or benchmark claim;
- `MODEL_CARD.md` front matter (`model_card_spec: "1.1"`), single H1, required heading order, and
  immutable provenance.

CI also runs `ruff check src tests tools`, `tools/build_notebook.py --check`, and the offline unit
suite (`tests/test_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_role_helpers.py`, `tests/test_notebook_parity.py`;
injected runner, no weights). These are source/provenance and unit checks. They are **not** execution
evidence.

## Executor paths

| Path | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Google Colab (supported user path) | Colab CPU runtime (CUDA bfloat16 used automatically when present) | The runtime the tutorial is written for; a clean top-to-bottom run here is promotion evidence |
| Kaggle CLI kernel or equivalent fresh container | Fresh CPU or GPU container, Python 3.12 image; the committed notebook executed verbatim, cell by cell, in a fresh interpreter with a `google.colab` shim and **no repository checkout** (the notebook is standalone) | Reproducible clean-room executor of the same class; needed whenever the hosted kernel pre-imports a NumPy or Pillow that differs from the `pyproject.toml` pins, because the tutorial's fail-closed stale-import guard correctly halts the in-kernel path after the pinned install |
| Local harness (pre-flight only) | Workstation, sequential cell executor with a `google.colab` shim, empty model cache | Builder pre-flight to catch defects before spending cloud runs; **not** a supported runtime and not promotion evidence |

## Supported release verification procedure

Before changing the registry status from `Candidate` to `Release-grade`:

1. resolve the exact PR/commit head under review and confirm static CI is green;
2. open that exact notebook revision in a new CPU or CUDA runtime (Colab, or a fresh-container
   executor above) with **no repository checkout**, an empty Hugging Face cache, and no pre-staged
   weight files under `weights/smolvlm-500m-instruct/`;
3. run the notebook top-to-bottom without editing implementation cells (form parameters at their
   defaults for the sample path: `USE_BYOD = False`, `PROMPTS` = the two default prompts,
   `MAX_NEW_TOKENS_PER_PROMPT = 96`);
4. verify that Section 1 reports `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE.repository_revision` equal to the revision recorded
   in `metadata.dimer.generated_from` and that the installed core package versions equal the inline
   `PINS` (= `pyproject.toml`) (`torch==2.14.0`, `transformers==4.57.6`, `huggingface-hub==0.36.2`, `safetensors==0.8.0`, `numpy==2.5.3`, `pillow==11.3.0`);
5. verify every default-path stage completes:
   - pinned runtime installed from the inline `PINS` with no GitHub access;
   - the carried module cell executes (defines `SmolVLMPipeline`, `validate_inputs`,
     `evaluation_report`, `build_messages`, `verify_snapshot`, `stage_missing_files`) with no import
     of the repository package;
   - synthetic 384 x 384 drawing (red square, blue circle) generated in code with its pixel SHA-256 printed and the two default prompts listed;
   - ceilings `MAX_IMAGES = 1`, `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE = 4096`, `MAX_TEXT_CHARS = 2000`, `MAX_NEW_TOKENS = 512`, `DEFAULT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS = 128`, `DECODING = greedy` printed, and `validate_inputs` writing `outputs/smolvlm_vision_language_input_manifest.json` with verdict `accepted`, one sub-manifest per prompt, and one recorded rejection finding from the over-long-prompt probe;
   - `stage_missing_files(..., allow_download=True)` reporting `['model.safetensors']` fetched from `HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct` at the immutable revision, `verify_snapshot` reporting the manifest file count, and `SmolVLMPipeline.from_pretrained` reporting `source: local-snapshot` and the effective dtype;
   - `generate` returning one answer per prompt with `do_sample: False`, `decoding: greedy`, `max_new_tokens: 96` in every `generation` block and all four plumbing checks true;
   - `evaluation_report` writing `outputs/smolvlm_vision_language_evaluation_report.json` with verdict `not-measurable`, an empty `metrics` list, one `answers` entry per prompt with its `new_tokens`/`truncated`, and `needs` naming the labelled data a real evaluation requires;
   - `outputs/smolvlm_vision_language_result.json` and `outputs/smolvlm_vision_language_answers.csv` written with the indexed answers (prompt, text, new_tokens, truncated, generation, seconds), plus `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE`, the model identifier, the immutable model revision, the model licence, the runtime versions, device and dtype;
6. verify the exports exist and the interpretation section matches the observed path;
7. record the notebook Git blob id, commit, runtime (platform, Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Pillow, device, dtype), model
   identifier and immutable revision, whether the model cache and weights directory were clean,
   outcome, produced outputs, the two answers verbatim with their `new_tokens`/`truncated` values (as observations), and any warning or applicable `SHOULD`
   deviation in the table below;
8. record no access tokens or other secrets.

A known-failing default path in the supported runtime blocks release.

## Manual clean-runtime evidence

| Notebook | Commit / notebook blob | Date (UTC) | Executor | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tutorials/smolvlm_vision_language_colab.ipynb` | | | | pending — queued to the GPU lane |

## Recorded executions

Notebook identity is the Git blob id of `tutorials/smolvlm_vision_language_colab.ipynb` (verify with
`git rev-parse <commit>:tutorials/smolvlm_vision_language_colab.ipynb`). Wall times are the sum of per-cell times reported by
the executor and include installs and the model download; they are measurements for the stated
runtime, not general estimates.

No execution of the notebook has been recorded. The only runtime measurements that exist for this repository are the pipeline smoke run documented in `MODEL_CARD.md` (CPU float32, load 5.71 s, 128 new tokens in 17.40 s on a 256 x 256 drawing of a red square; the answer invented that the square's corners touched the edges). That run exercised the
package, not this notebook, and is not notebook execution evidence.

| Date (UTC) | Commit / notebook blob | Executor | Path exercised | Wall | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Current status

The notebook source is complete and passes the static checks above, including the generator parity
checks (`--check` OK); **no clean-runtime execution has been recorded**, so the registry status is **Candidate** and the manual-evidence row is pending.
Promotion requires a reviewer to confirm a recorded run against the notebook blob under review and
an integrator to promote it; promotion is not performed by the builder. The commit that adds a
recorded-execution row changes documentation only; the executed source is the commit named in the
row. One fact a reviewer should weigh: **the standalone carrier itself — executing the carried
module cell in a runtime that has no repository checkout — has been validated statically only
(parity PASS) and never run**, so the clean run will be the first execution of the standalone path
and of the real `hf_hub_download` staging path.
